# byte-convert-avro
Contains a kafka transforms plugin that converts confluent bytecode to schema included avro files

I couldn't find any public resource that is capable of providing this functionality which was required for our project, so we decided to build our own.

Thanks to the ING Dora team for providing me with a sample code and repository to start with. This really helped me get a jumpstart on this project.

Turns out this sample code was taken from https://github.com/OneCricketeer/schema-registry-transfer-smt, many thanks!
